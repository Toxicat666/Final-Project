# Temprature Indicate Thermos
I propose to build an Temprature Indicate Thermos: a thermos that shows you the temprature of the content with a few LED lights
## Summary
There is a heat sensor inside the thermos and the LED lights outside the thermos will show different colors accroding to different temperature range.
The goal of the project is prevent people from burn themselves by hot water in the thermos.
## Component Parts
-Battery
-A chip, to transfer heat data into commands to LED lights
-Heat sensor
## Challenges
The sensor will be put in liquid so I need to find a way to make all the components water-proof
## Timeline
1-Order a heat sensor,some LED lights,some wires, a thermos 
2-Build a first version & work on the code
3-Put them into the thermos and work on making it water proof
4-Test and debug
5-Present complete project
